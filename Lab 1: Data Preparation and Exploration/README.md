# Lab: Forest Fire Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview

This lab focuses on applying foundational concepts in machine learning to the problem of forest fire prediction. By working through the steps of problem formulation, data gathering, exploration, preprocessing, and visualization, you will strengthen your understanding of the machine learning pipeline while addressing a critical environmental challenge.

## Goals

- Reinforce concepts of problem formulation, data gathering, data visualization, and preprocessing.
- Learn to analyze and clean a real-world dataset.
- Begin exploring ways to predict forest fires using meteorological data.

## Agenda

1. **Review Jupyter Notebook Concepts**  
   Refresh your understanding of Jupyter notebooks to ensure smooth progress.

2. **Download Forest Fire Dataset**  
   Obtain data from the UCI Repository to begin working with real-world meteorological data.

3. **Problem Definition**  
   Formulate the problem by addressing:
   - What the problem is
   - Why solving it is important
   - How we might approach solving it

4. **Data Exploration and Visualization**  
   Load the dataset into Pandas and explore it using visualizations to uncover meaningful insights.

5. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   Clean and transform the data, addressing missing values, encoding categorical data, and splitting the dataset for training and testing.

## Problem Statement

This lab addresses forest fire prediction, a pressing environmental issue with widespread consequences. The focus is on predicting fires in specific national parks using meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

### Why is this important?  
Forest fire prediction can:
- Prevent fires by identifying high-risk areas.
- Help firefighters prioritize efforts and respond more effectively.

### How will we solve this?  
Using labeled meteorological data, we aim to:
1. Identify features such as temperature and wind speed that correlate with fires.
2. Build predictive models to forecast either the likelihood of fires or the extent of the burned area.

## Summary

By completing this lab, you will develop skills in:
- Problem-solving and planning in machine learning.
- Data gathering and preprocessing.
- Visualization and exploratory data analysis.

This lab lays the foundation for future exercises and deeper explorations into machine learning applications for environmental and societal challenges.
