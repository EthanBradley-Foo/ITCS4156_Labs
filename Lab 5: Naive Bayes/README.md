# Lab: Gaussian Naive Bayes and the Iris Dataset

## Overview

In this lab, you will practice using the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for classification. The Iris dataset, a classical dataset in machine learning, will be used to demonstrate this technique. You will learn how to implement and apply Naive Bayes for multi-class classification.

## Goals

- Implement and train a Gaussian Naive Bayes model for classification.
- Explore multi-class classification using the Iris dataset.

## Agenda

1. **Review and Load the Iris Dataset via Sklearn**  
   Load the Iris dataset using Scikit-learn for classification.

2. **Quickly Re-visualize the Iris Dataset**  
   Visualize the dataset to get a better understanding of the features.

3. **Create the Data Preparation Pipeline**  
   Prepare the dataset by applying preprocessing steps after splitting.

4. **Implement Gaussian Naive Bayes**  
   Train and evaluate a Gaussian Naive Bayes model for classification.

5. **Investigate Multi-Class Classification Using Different Features**  
   Experiment with different feature combinations and evaluate classification performance.

## Iris Dataset Problem Summary

The Iris dataset is a well-known multivariate dataset introduced by British statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936. It is often used as a beginner dataset for machine learning classification.

**Dataset Details:**
- **Samples:** 150 total (50 samples each for 3 Iris species: *Iris setosa*, *Iris virginica*, and *Iris versicolor*).
- **Features:**  
  - Sepal length (cm)  
  - Sepal width (cm)  
  - Petal length (cm)  
  - Petal width (cm)  
- **Goal:** The goal is to classify each sample into one of three species: *Iris setosa*, *Iris virginica*, or *Iris versicolor*.

In this lab, you will focus on using the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for classification and experiment with multi-class classification using various feature combinations.

## Summary

Through this lab, you will:
- Implement the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for multi-class classification.
- Explore how feature selection impacts classification performance with the Iris dataset.
