# Lab: Ridge and Polynomial Regression for Forest Fire Prediction

## Overview

This lab focuses on continuing the practice of training, evaluating, and making predictions with machine learning models. Specifically, you'll explore ridge regression and polynomial regression using the algorithms covered in the linear regression module: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Least Means Squares (LMS). By working with the Forest Fire dataset, you'll implement and train these models to deepen your understanding of regression techniques.

**Note:** This is the final week working with the Forest Fire dataset for now!

## Goals

- Practice advanced regression techniques: ridge regression and polynomial regression.
- Use regularization to improve model performance.
- Build and compare models trained with OLS and LMS.

## Agenda

1. **Load Data**  
   Begin by loading the Forest Fire dataset.

2. **Removing Outliers**  
   Identify and remove outliers from the dataset to improve model performance.

3. **Create the Data Preparation Pipeline**  
   Construct a pipeline with a new processing order.

4. **Implement and Train Linear Ordinary Least Squares with Regularization**  
   Train an OLS model with ridge regularization.

5. **Train Polynomial Ordinary Least Squares with Regularization**  
   Extend OLS to polynomial regression and apply ridge regularization.

6. **Implement Least Means Squares with Regularization and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**  
   Train an LMS model with regularization using mini-batch gradient descent.

7. **Train Polynomial Least Means Squares with Regularization**  
   Extend LMS to polynomial regression with regularization.

8. **Select and Test the Best Model**  
   Evaluate all models and determine the best performer.

## Problem Statement Summary

The aim of this lab is to support forest fire prevention and firefighting efforts by predicting "high risk" areas. Specifically, we focus on predicting how much forest area (in hectares) could burn during a fire. This task leverages supervised learning techniques where the labels correspond to historical data on burned areas.

## Summary

By completing this lab, you will:
- Gain experience implementing ridge and polynomial regression.
- Learn to apply regularization to enhance model robustness.
- Practice selecting and evaluating the best regression model for real-world applications.

This lab builds on previous activities, emphasizing advanced regression techniques for better prediction accuracy.
