# Lab: Forest Fire Prediction with Linear Models

## Overview

This lab focuses on advancing through the remaining steps of the machine learning pipeline, including training models, evaluating them, and making predictions. By applying Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Least Means Squares (LMS) models, you'll gain hands-on experience with foundational supervised learning techniques.

## Goals

- Practice training and evaluating machine learning models.
- Apply OLS and LMS algorithms to predict forest fire outcomes.
- Build on the preprocessed Forest Fire dataset to focus on model implementation.

## Agenda

1. **Load Data**  
   Load the Forest Fire dataset to begin the modeling process.

2. **Test the First Linear Assumption: Linearity**  
   Analyze the dataset to ensure it satisfies the assumption of linearity.

3. **Recreate Data Preparation Pipeline**  
   Replicate the necessary data preprocessing steps to ready the dataset for training.

4. **Implement Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**  
   Apply the OLS algorithm to the dataset to make predictions.

5. **Check Remaining Linear Assumptions**  
   Evaluate additional assumptions required for linear models to function effectively.

6. **Review Gradient Descent**  
   Revisit the fundamentals of gradient descent to prepare for LMS implementation.

7. **Implement Least Means Squares (LMS)**  
   Train a model using the LMS algorithm.

8. **Test the Best Model**  
   Compare and evaluate the performance of both models to determine the best approach.

## Problem Statement Summary

The goal of this lab is to support efforts to prevent and manage forest fires by predicting "high risk" areas. Specifically, we aim to forecast how much of an area is likely to burn during a forest fire. This problem will be approached using supervised learning techniques, where the labels correspond to the expected burned area.

## Summary

By completing this lab, you will:
- Learn to implement and evaluate OLS and LMS algorithms.
- Strengthen your understanding of linear model assumptions.
- Gain experience comparing and selecting machine learning models for real-world problems.

This lab builds on previous activities, emphasizing the transition from data preparation to model training and evaluation.
